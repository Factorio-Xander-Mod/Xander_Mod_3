    * Economic Stone Formation
    * Pegmatite-Type Ore

* __Materials and Parts (Partial list)__

    * Borax, limestone, kaolin clay, quartz sand, fluorite, scheelite
    * Aluminum, nickel, tin, tungsten, solder, bronze, cast iron, alloy steel
    * Clay bricks, magnesia refractory, porcelain, glass, silicon carbide
    * Potash, saltpeter, cryolite
    * Raw and vulcanized rubber; phenolic resin - the first synthetic plastic
    * Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine
    * Brine and distilled waters, nitric acid, hydrogen fluoride
    * Steel parts, standard and improved inductive coils
    * Circuits made from patterned boards, component sets, and solder
    * Steam and internal combustion engine units, 
    * New crude science pack, new recipes for automation and chemical packs

* __Processes and Machines (Partial list)__

    * Pyrolysis of wood and coal to make charcoal and coke
    * Fluxed metal smelting for higher yield
    * Bayer Process and Hall-Heroult Process aluminum production
    * Chamber process sulfuric acid production
    * Air distillation and Haber-Bosch Process ammonia
    * Chloralkali process for chlorine, hydrogen, sodium hydroxide
    * New ore processor, to wash ores into separate components
    * Overhauled furnace tiers for much greater versatility
    * New machine tool, to produce simple parts from stock material
    * Early burner versions of most machines

* __Technologies__

    * Crude first steps: coal coke, glass, steel, firearms, ore washing, steam-driven machinery
    * Metal refining: nickel, tungsten, aluminum, silicon
    * Nonmetal chemistry: boron, carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine
    * Intermediates thoroughly integrated in tech tree: electricity, electronics 1 and 2, steel parts, induction motor
    * Coherent prerequisites to unlock better machines

* __Equipment and Combat__

    * Crude transport belts for inexpensive early automation
    * Black powder for early firearms

### This iteration of the mod also aims to correct several issues from the previous version (2.x) with several improvements, namely

* Easier balancing for increased playability
* Faster and more rewarding progression
* Greater consistency in degree and detail of approximations
* Original graphical models
